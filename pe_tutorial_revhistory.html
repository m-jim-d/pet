	<p>The content, at pet.triquence.org, is a bit 
	much for a single J-term course. We did not cover everything. A regular semester might be a better container.</p>
	<p><strong class="title_2">Scope</strong></p>
	<p>Here's the pattern followed in the J-term course:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Worked through most of the 1D assignments. Made the <em>Gui Controls</em> 
		and the <em>Hollow Cars and Demos</em> assignments optional.</li>
		<li>Presented the <em>Vector Class Module</em> and the <em>2D Framework</em>, but made the assignments optional. 
		This makes a good 
		weekend (or two or three) challenge for those students that have coding experience.</li>
		<li>Presented the <em>Multiplayer Demo</em> (networking) assignment. This 
		makes a very nice in-class demo where multiple students (with laptops) 
		can connect their clients to the server which is rendering to a large 
		projection screen in the room. But again, the development of the 
		client/server files is a good overload assignment for students looking 
		for more. However, this can be taken as a result and used by those that want 
		multiplayer functionality in their game. </li>
		<li>Then it was back to required assignments where the students learned 
		techniques for embellishing their moving pucks to make them playable: 
		rotating turrets, firing bullets (and the associated impulse forces), 
		visual indicators of health, etc. All the assignments between the <em>
		2D Framework</em> and the <em>Perfect Kiss</em> were required.</li>
		<li>At this point, they started working on projects while I presented the 
		material on Pybox2d. There are no required assignments here. A few 
		students used this in the end for their projects, but most used our 
		own <em>2D Framework</em>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong class="title_2">Revisions</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>June, 2019<ul>
			<li>Added topic on <a href="index.html?countpi" target="_blank">
			calculating pi</a> with collision counting.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>May, 2019<ul>
			<li>Added a second video on the reversibility of the
			<a href="index.html?perfect-kiss">Perfect Kiss</a> algorithm.</li>
			<li>Code changes for demonstrating the reversibility of Perfect 
			Kiss:<ul>
				<li>Refined the game loop to give the option to limit (clamp) 
				the game loop FPS and set a corresponding fixed timestep for the 
				physics engine calculations. "Shift-p" toggles in and out of 
				fixed-timestep mode. The current FPS is used as the clamping 
				limit and the associated fixed timestep. The clamped FPS is 
				shown in parenthesis.</li>
				<li>The "e" key sets all pucks to have elastic collisions.</li>
				<li>The "z" key (as before) enables the perfect-kiss algorithm. 
				Now it also sets all collisions to be elastic and displays a 
				collision counter in the upper left corner.</li>
				<li>The "r" key reverses the velocity of all pucks. "Shift-r" 
				reverses the direction of time incrementation.</li>
				<li>The "t" key starts and stops a general timer.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>November, 2016<ul>
			<li>Started translating the final assignment (A16c_2D_B2D_serverN) 
			into JavaScript for running in a web browser using the HTML5 Canvas. 
			See main page at <a href="https://triquence.org">
			triquence.org</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>January, 2016<ul>
			<li>Added the <a href="raspberrypi.html">Raspberry Pi 2</a> page. 
			Script revisions are discussed at the end of the RPi page.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>October, 2015<ul>
			<li>Added the <a href="index.html?one-d">pure-Python</a> 
			physics engine (a.k.a. string rendering; a.k.a. the one-pager).</li>
			<li>Added this revision-history page.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>August, 2014<ul>
			<li>Updated the <a href="index.html?pygame">installation</a> files in the zip.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>July, 2013<ul>
			<li>Added <a href="index.html?vector-sandbox">Vector 
			Sandbox</a>.<br />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Added <a href="index.html?perfect-kiss">Perfect 
			Kiss</a>.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>June, 2013<ul>
			<li>Added conceptual drawings for the content in the PDFs.</li>
			<li>Improved the documentation for the 2D framework and 
			multiplayer-networking code.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
