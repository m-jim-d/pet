            <strong class="title_2">Why do this? </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Why render the output from a physics engine to a string of characters and
            then print that string to the command line (see animated gif above)? And why
            are there two versions of this code?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It's a friendly start: </strong>The 1-D motion of a car is
                calculated in 2 of the 44 lines of code that are in the one-page version.
                There's more complexity later,
                but it comes in steps.<br />
                &nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Detach the rendering:</strong> Rendering to a string makes it clear that rendering and the
                engine are distinct. An engine can drive rendering in whatever form a
                renderer
                might take. You can render a 1-D engine to a long row of students, or a
                row of LEDs, or as we are doing here, a row of characters (a string).<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Provide the first of two looks at the basic engine: </strong>
                The <a href="index.html?1D-FrameWork">next</a> assignment
                combines Pygame with the first elements of an engine and puts it all in
                classes to form the outline of the 1-D framework. That's a lot for
                someone new to coding. This one page of code serves to distill everything down to
                three main concepts: (1) the engine moves things, (2) the engine detects
                wall collisions and resolves them, and (3) the renderer
                presents the output from the engine.<br />
                &nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Check the student's coding experience:</strong> If a student
                has no coding experience, this single page of code is a good place to start with
                functions and loops.<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make a transition to classes:</strong> The two versions of the
                code help to introduce the new programmer to the ideas behind classes. The
                #1 file (the one-pager) is procedural and with no grouping of data in any
                sort of object-oriented way. The #2 file takes a first step toward class-like
                structures and groups data in dictionaries that reflect objects in this
                application: the <strong>track</strong>, the <strong>car</strong> on the
                track, and the overall <strong>environment</strong> that both are in.
                This transition from procedural code to OOP code is continued in the
                next assignment
                on the main page (<a href="index.html?1D-FrameWork">1D-Framework</a>).<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Show some interesting stuff in Python:</strong> Why learn everything
                in a strict linear pattern? There are some quirky (and somewhat random)
                little coding concepts used in the second file that are simple enough to
                be clear to the beginner but still fun to learn about.<br />
                &nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong class="title_2">The One-Pager</strong></p>
        <p>At the center of this <a href="index.html?one-d">rendering approach</a> is the function,
            <span class="CodeWords_yellow">render_airtrack</span><em>,</em> that
            constructs the <span class="CodeWords_purple">126</span> character string (see
            embedded code below or view the
            <a href="A02.1_string_rendering_v1.html" target="_blank">full page</a> in a new tab).
            This function uses a <span class="CodeWords_blue">for</span>
            loop which repeatedly adds to the string, one character at a time. Inside
            this loop, the <span class="CodeWords_blue">if</span> statement compares the
            <span class="CodeWords_white">j</span> loop index against the integer positions provided in the three
            inputs. The position of the left and right edges of the
            track are marked with the <span class="CodeWords_green">'|'</span> character.
            The position of the car (on the track) is marked using the
            <span class="CodeWords_green">'*'</span> character. Everything
            <span class="CodeWords_blue">else</span> (the empty space on the track that
            isn't occupied by the car) is represented with the
            <span class="CodeWords_green">' '</span> character (a blank).
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">
            import time

            def render_airtrack(x_px, x_left_edge_px, x_right_edge_px):
                string = ''
                display_width_px = 126 # 126/7 = 18 meters
                for j in range(0, display_width_px):
                    if (j == x_px):
                        string += '*'
                    elif (j==x_left_edge_px) or (j==x_right_edge_px):
                        string += '|'
                    else:
                        string += ' '
                return string
            </code></pre>

        <p>The output of the physics engine, the position of the car, must be converted
            to the discrete representation of the world offered by renderer (in our case, a
            126 character string). This conversion from the world to the screen can be as
            simple as applying a scaling factor (like the <span class="CodeWords_purple">7.0</span>
            used in <span class="CodeWords_yellow">m_to_px</span>) and then converting
            to an integer (using Python's <span class="CodeWords_green">round</span>
            function). This conversion is an opportunity to zoom-in or zoom-out before the
            rendering (as illustrated in example 6 in the
            <a href="index.html?one-d">video</a>).
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">
            def m_to_px(x_m):
                return round(x_m * 7.0)   # pixels per meter.
        </code></pre>

        <p>The <span class="CodeWords_yellow">render_airtrack</span> function is called
            inside the animation loop of the <span class="CodeWords_yellow">main</span>
            script function (see code below). Here, in <span class="CodeWords_yellow">main</span>, the speed
            and position of the car is
            calculated (the physics engine) and supplied to the rendering function. The
            motion calculations are in the highlighted lines, 42-43 (Euler's Method).</p>
        <p>In lines 46-48, the position of the car is checked against the wall
            positions (or ends of the track). If the car has penetrated the wall, the
            direction of the motion is reversed (a bounce) and the penetration of the
            wall is resolved (stickiness correction). </p>
        <p>Lines 39 and 55 put the primary block of code into a basic error-catching
            structure. This allows the user to cleanly stop the script by issuing a
            Ctrl-c from the keyboard. A more useful error-catching structure is shown below
            in the longer version of the code.</p>

            Prism issue: Unexpect behavior in data-line-offset when using the Line Numbers plugin with the Line Highlight plugin. 
            Needs to be high. If it is removed, or set too low, the higher line targets will not get highlighted. Buggy. 
            Farther down on this page, in the full-file code case, the data-line-offset is removed and that works fine there. 
            
            So, eventually I punted and stopped trying to also have line numbers: removed the line-numbers class from the pre tag
            and also removed the data-start attribute (which of course seems to be in conflict (by definition) with the data-line-offset
            attribute).That punt resolved the data-line-offset issue. Also, downloaded (fresh) the prism files without the 
            Line Number plugin. 
            
            Saved the old prism files (with a v1 suffix). These have some edits to the css that might be worth having later. I
            tried to make that highlighting more distinctive with a fully black background and a lighter shade for the highlights
            in the left-to-right gradient. 
            
            It's useful, to me, to think of this data-line-offset parameter as a cropping aid, that in effect, produces line numbers 
            that correctly correspond to the original file. So for example, if your code (here) has been cropped to remove the first 2 lines, 
            then the data-line-offset parameter should be set to 2. That will cause the line numbers to start at 3 and you will get 
            correct correspondence with the original uncropped file.

            can happen when gravity and non-elastic collisions cause the penetrating motion
            to be more than the recovering (rebounding) motion. The result can be that the
            car remains stuck on the other side of the wall. The simple method used here brings the car back to the wall

        <p>Note that there is no global scope in the one-pager version of the code.
            All variables are passed in as immutable objects. These are not changed
            inside the functions! Local results are returned at the end of each

        <p>This longer version (#2) of the code is (conceptually) very similar to the
            one-pager described above: calculated motion, collision detection and
            resolution, and rendering to a string. Features have been added to
            facilitate the making of the <a href="index.html?one-d">video</a> and also serve as a stepping stone to the
            class structures used in the
            <a href="index.html?1D-FrameWork">next</a> section. The following animated gif is a
            screen capture from example #10. To see example #10 running in the command
            window, run the file from the command line with a
            <span class="CodeWords_white">10</span> after the filename. To see the
            numeric-output details from the engine, run with
            <span class="CodeWords_white">10 d</span> after the filename.

            The comments below, intended to draw focus to the added features of this

                explaining in detail here, this longer version of the code uses a
                completely different approach to name space and the issue of how-to-change-stuff
                inside the functions. (This is intentional and hopefully
                instructive.) Most of the
                dictionaries have been given <span class="CodeWords_blue">global</span>
                scope. This allows them (for better, or some would say, worse) to be
                modified inside functions without being passed in. In contrast, the <span
                    class="CodeWords_white">car</span> dictionary is
                not global and is passed into functions and is changeable there. Dictionaries are mutable Python
                objects and can be changed inside the function if they are passed in
                (even if they don't have global scope). Note that if a single immutable
                object, like a simple variable (or even a single key from a dictionary),
                is passed into a function, it cannot be changed inside.</li>
