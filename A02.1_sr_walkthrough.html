	<strong class="title_2">Why do this? </strong></p>
	<p>Why render the output from a physics engine to a string of characters and 
	then print that string to the command line (see animated gif above)? And why 
	are there two versions of this code?</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>It's a friendly start: </strong>The 1-D motion of a car is 
		calculated in 2 of the 44 lines of code that are in the one-page version. 
		There's more complexity later, 
		but it comes in steps.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><strong>Detach the rendering:</strong> Rendering to a string makes it clear that rendering and the 
		engine are distinct. An engine can drive rendering in whatever form a 
		renderer 
		might take. You can render a 1-D engine to a long row of students, or a 
		row of LEDs, or as we are doing here, a row of characters (a string).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
		</li>
		<li><strong>Provide the first of two looks at the basic engine: </strong>
		The <a href="index.html?1D-FrameWork">next</a> assignment 
		combines Pygame with the first elements of an engine and puts it all in 
		classes to form the outline of the 1-D framework. That's a lot for 
		someone new to coding. This one page of code serves to distill everything down to 
		three main concepts: (1) the engine moves things, (2) the engine detects 
		wall collisions and resolves them, and (3) the renderer 
		presents the output from the engine.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><strong>Check the student's coding experience:</strong> If a student 
		has no coding experience, this single page of code is a good place to start with 
		functions and loops.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
		</li>
		<li><strong>Make a transition to classes:</strong> The two versions of the 
		code help to introduce the new programmer to the ideas behind classes. The 
		#1 file (the one-pager) is procedural and with no grouping of data in any 
		sort of object-oriented way. The #2 file takes a first step toward class-like 
		structures and groups data in dictionaries that reflect objects in this 
		application: the <strong>track</strong>, the <strong>car</strong> on the 
		track, and the overall <strong>environment</strong> that both are in. 
		This transition from procedural code to OOP code is continued in the 
		next assignment 
		on the main page (<a href="index.html?1D-FrameWork">1D-Framework</a>).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
		</li>
		<li><strong>Show some interesting stuff in Python:</strong> Why learn everything 
		in a strict linear pattern? There are some quirky (and somewhat random) 
		little coding concepts used in the second file that are simple enough to 
		be clear to the beginner but still fun to learn about.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong class="title_2">The One-Pager</strong></p>
	<p>At the center of this <a href="index.html?one-d">rendering approach</a> is the function,
	<span class="CodeWords_white">render_airtrack</span><em>,</em> that 
	constructs the <span class="CodeWord_green">125</span> character string (see 
	embedded code below or view the
	<a href="A02.1_string_rendering_v1.html" target="_blank">full page</a> in a new tab). 
	This function uses a <span class="CodeWords_blue">for</span> 
	loop which repeatedly adds to the string, one character at a time. Inside 
	this loop, the<span class="CodeWords_blue"> if </span>statement compares the<span class="CodeWords_white"> 
	j </span>loop index against the integer positions provided in the three 
	inputs. The position of the left and right edges of the 
	track are marked with the <span class="CodeWord_green">'|'</span> character. 
	The position of the car (on the track) is marked using the
	<span class="CodeWord_green">'*'</span> character. Everything
	<span class="CodeWords_blue">else</span> (the empty space on the track that 
	isn't occupied by the car) is represented with the
	<span class="CodeWord_green">' '</span> character (a blank).</p>


<pre class="brush:python; first-line:4; highlight: []">
import time

def render_airtrack(x_px, x_left_edge_px, x_right_edge_px):
    string = ''
    display_width_px = 125
    for j in range(0, display_width_px + 1):
        if (j == x_px):
            string += '*'

            string += '|'
        else:
            string += ' '
    return string
</pre>

<p>The output of the physics engine, the position of the car, must be converted 
to the discrete representation of the world offered by renderer (in our case, a 
125 character string). This conversion from the world to the screen can be as 
simple as applying a scaling factor (like the<span class="CodeWord_green"> 7
</span>used in <span class="CodeWords_white">m_to_px</span>) and then converting 
to an integer (using Python's<span class="CodeWords_orange"> int </span>
function). This conversion is an opportunity to zoom-in or zoom-out before the 
rendering (as illustrated in example 6 in the
<a href="index.html?one-d">video</a>).</p>

<pre class="brush:python; first-line:18; highlight: []">
def m_to_px(x_m):
    return int(round( x_m * 7.0))   # pixels per meter.	
</pre>

<p>The <span class="CodeWords_white">render_airtrack</span> function is called 
inside the animation loop of the <span class="CodeWords_white">main</span> 
script function (see code below). Here, in <span class="CodeWords_white">main</span>, the speed 
and position of the car is 
calculated (the physics engine) and supplied to the rendering function. The 
motion calculations are in the highlighted lines, 41-42 (Euler's Method).</p>
	<p>In lines 45-47, the position of the car is checked against the wall 
	positions (or ends of the track). If the car has penetrated the wall, the 
	direction of the motion is reversed (a bounce) and the penetration of the 
	wall is resolved (stickiness correction). </p>
	<p>Lines 39 and 53 put the primary block of code into a basic error-catching 
	structure. This allows the user to cleanly stop the script by issuing a 
	Ctrl-c from the keyboard. A more useful error-catching structure is shown below 
	in the longer version of the code.</p>

<p>The function <span class="CodeWords_white">x_fix_sticky</span> is used to 
resolve the penetration. The <a href="index.html?one-d">video</a> for the 
long-version of this code shows a case where the car sticks to the wall. This 
can happen when gravity and non-elastic collisions cause the penetrating motion 
to be more than the recovering (rebounding) motion. The result can be that the 
car remains stuck on the other side of the wall. The simple method used here brings the car back to the wall surface in the frame that the penetration is 
observed.</p>	
	
<pre class="brush:python; first-line:21; highlight: [];">

	<p>Note that there is no global scope in the one-pager version of the code. 
	All variables are passed in as immutable objects. These are not changed 
	inside the functions! Local results are returned at the end of each 
	function. A different technique for modifying variables is used in the 
	longer version of the code.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong class="title_2">The Longer Version</strong></p>
	<p>Conceptually this longer version (#2) of the code is very similar to the 
	one-pager described above: calculated motion, collision detection and 
	resolution, and rendering to a string. Features have been added to 
	facilitate the making of the <a href="index.html?one-d">video</a> and also serve as a stepping stone to the 
	class structures used in the 
	<a href="index.html?1D-FrameWork">next</a> section. The following animated gif is a 
	screen capture from example #10. To see example #10 running in the command 
	window, run the file from the command line with a
	<span class="CodeWords_white">&nbsp;10</span> after the filename. To see the 
	numeric-output details from the engine, run with
	<span class="CodeWords_white">&nbsp;10 d</span> after the filename.</p>
	<p><strong><img width="978" height="165" src="screenshots/elastic.gif" alt="elastic bouncing"></strong></p>
	<p>At the end of this page is a scrollable window for the code (alternately, 
	here's a <a href="A02.1_string_rendering_v2.html" target="_blank">full-page</a> view in a new tab). 
	The comments below, intended to draw focus to the added features of this 
	longer version, make reference to the line numbers in the code. The 
	scrollable window has the first line, of a referenced range of lines, marked 
	by a lighter background.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>510-524,<strong> dictionaries: </strong>These act to group similar 
		variables together into mutable objects.</li>
		<li>504,<strong> globals and mutable objects:</strong> Without 
		explaining in detail here, this longer version of the code uses a 
		completely different approach to name space and the issue of how-to-change-stuff 
		inside the functions. (This is intentional and hopefully 
		instructive.) Most of the 
		dictionaries have been given <span class="CodeWords_blue">global</span> 
		scope. This allows them (for better, or some would say, worse) to be 
		modified inside functions without being passed in. In contrast, the<span class="CodeWords_white"> car 
		</span>dictionary is 
		not global and is passed into functions and is changeable there. Dictionaries are mutable Python 
		objects and can be changed inside the function if they are passed in 
		(even if they don't have global scope). Note that if a single immutable 
		object, like a simple variable (or even a single key from a dictionary), 
		is passed into a function, it cannot be changed inside.</li>
		<li>492-501,<strong> </strong> 225-481;<strong> command-line input and the "canned" examples for the 
		video:</strong> The example runs are initiated by adding a number after 
		the filename on the command line. Each example initializes parameters 
		that determine the starting state of the car and the computation 
		options.</li>
		<li>4, 178-179, 199-221,<strong> the headers and formatted paragraphs: </strong>
		At the beginning of each run is a header with a parameter summary. This 
		is followed by formatted paragraphs that are generated using Python's
		<span class="CodeWords_white">dedent </span>and
		<span class="CodeWords_white">fill </span>procedures from Python's
		<span class="CodeWords_white">textwrap </span>module.</li>
		<li>166,<strong> formatted numeric output:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes it's nice 
		to have numbers line up (vertically) based on a decimal point. Here's 
		an example of how that can be done.</li>
		<li>143-161,<strong> enhanced string rendering:</strong> This 
		enhancement to the renderer has features for persistent marking of the 
		start position of the car and also a mark for the position of the car 
		at the point of collision detection.</li>
		<li>19, 46-98; <strong>&nbsp;an exact calculation:</strong> The 
		approximate Euler's method can be optionally replaced with an exact 
		calculation of motion (see example runs 10, 11, and 12.</li>
		<li>170-173, 483-490; <strong>auto-off:</strong> This little feature 
		shuts down the script based on a comparison of the average car position 
		(over the last 10 frames) and the position of the ends of the 
		track.</li>
