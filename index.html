      <p>This sequence of topics reflects a J-term course given at
      <a href="https://gustavus.edu/" target="_blank">Gustavus Adolphus</a> College 
      in 2013. </p>
	  <p>Much of this content is demonstrated on the
	  <a href="https://triquence.org" target="_blank">Springs &amp; Pucks</a> 
	  page using a live HTML5 
	  Canvas. Here are links to the corresponding
	  video <a href="https://triquence.org/videos.html" target="_blank">walkthrough</a> 
	  and the games:
	  <a href="https://triquence.org/?8c" target="_blank">puck popper</a>,

	  <a href="https://triquence.org/?3d" target="_blank">ghost-ball pool</a>, and 
	  <a href="https://triquence.org/?5e.basketball" target="_blank">bipartisan hoops</a>.
     </p>
	  <p>This was originally presented in a classroom with a mixture of lecture and 
      lab; most of this had verbal explanation. The <a href="pe_tutorial_revhistory.html">revision history</a> 
      has a discussion on the scope of the J-term
	  <a href="pygame.html" target="_blank">course</a>.</p>
	  <p>It's posted here in support of any that wish to offer the course 
	  and for the curious out there who want to play with this 
      on their own. It's a great way to gain useful coding experience and learn the 
      Python language.</p>
      
      <p>This tutorial emphasizes the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>This is a progression starting from very basic <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="pygame" href="#">Pygame</a>
         ideas, through <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="one-d" href="#">1D</a> and <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="two-d" href="#">2D</a> (pure 
         Python) physics engines, ending with an application of the
         <a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="box2d" href="#">Box2D</a> physics engine.</li>
         <li>There is a physics instructor behind this. So, there are 
         references to things like:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_track" target="_blank">air tracks</a> 
         and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_hockey" target="_blank">air 
         tables</a>, separation of rendering from floating-point calculation 
         engines, Euler's method, impulse and non-impulse collision calculations, 
         and object-penetration correction (anti-stickiness). Students need only 
         have experience with vectors.</li>
         <li><a class="scroll-link" data-scroll-target="multiplayerdemo" href="#">Multiplayer</a> networking supports tournament play.</li>
         <li>This content is aimed at students of a January-term class.
         <a href="pe_tutorial_revhistory.html">Much</a> has to be absorbed in 
         about 2.5 weeks (two lectures and a lab each day), leaving about a week for team-based project work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each topic below has the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>An assignment in PDF form that includes a problem statement, reference 
         material, algorithms, conceptual drawings, and (sometimes obfuscated) code 
         hints. The good stuff is in the PDFs.</li>
         <li>Source code</li>
         <li>A screen-capture video of the code running and rendering in a Pygame 
         window (the videos can also be viewed from this
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyZaQYYgglw&amp;list=PLTMmJ3C3RoL9hQK9Dr95wSD91y_askNyX" target="_blank">

      <p>This first assignment illustrates the display window and event-handling 
      features that are used from Pygame. Drawing, erasing, and screen 
      updating are viewed in the Pygame window. Keyboard and mouse events 
      are interpreted and used to control the drawing algorithms. A game 
      loop keeps repeating the process: erase, draw, update the screen. 
      Holding down the "e" key enables screen erasing every time through 
      the game loop. Holding down the "f" inhibits the flip operation 
      that is use to update the screen at the end of the game loop. The 
      two mouse buttons are used to change the color of the circle.
      </p>
      <p>The video starts with the erase feature. With erasing enabled, 
      the ball seems animated (the drawing tail does not persist). Later 
      the flip (screen update) operation is inhibited (these are drawn 
      in memory but not to the screen). Finally a combination of erasing 
      and flip inhibiting cause the ball to lag behind and then catch 
      up to the cursor.</p>

      / <a href="A02.1_string_rendering_v2.html" target="_blank">Code 
      #2</a></p>
      <p>This first look at a 1D-physics engine does so without any rendering 
      in the Pygame display window. Instead, this outputs to a simple text string that is 
      printed to the command line. The #1 version is fully functional 
      with only one page of Python code. The #2 version can be executed 
      with command-line parameters and facilitates running the various 
      examples in the video.<br></p>
      <p>The video is best viewed in full-screen mode so that the preliminary 
      text, before each example run, can be read. Near the beginning of 
      the video, an annotation block is used to help the viewer direct 
      (and keep) his gaze on the first row of output. This first row yields 
      the intended animation effect: move, draw, erase, repeat. There 
      is an animated-gif capture of the "first row" displayed at the top 
      of the <a href="A02.1_sr_walkthrough.html">code discussion</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>This rendering approach has the added advantage of preserving 
      the frame history. As the viewer looks up to higher rows on the 
      screen he is looking back in time, frame by frame (row by row). 
      This can help in visualizing and understanding wall collisions and 
      the associated position corrections that are made.</p>

      <p>The 1D framework introduces the relationship between the screen 
      and the physics world. It also brings in the first taste of Euler's 
      method in animating the motion. There are no car-wall or car-car 
      collisions here; no gravity. Cars just pass through each other (and 
      walls) and no acceleration from gravity. OOP classes are used here 
      to organize the code and prepare for the object nature of the games 
      to follow.</p>
      <p>The video shows five short demos (press keyboard numbers 1 through 
      5). The first two are two-car animations. The last three show stacks 
      of cars spreading out due to the differences in their velocities. 
      The car in the middle of the stack has zero velocity. At any point 
      in time, the relative velocity of any pair of cars is proportional 
      to the separation distance between them (kind of like Hubble's law).</p>

      <p>Euler's method comes to life here. Velocities are changing under 
      the accelerating influence of gravity. There is a drawing in the 
      PDF that illustrates the idea of penetration/stickiness correction. 
      (Note that the drawings in the PDFs display with varying quality 
      depending on the browser; Chrome: great, IE: OK, Firefox: not so 
      hot.) For now, we'll just do the stickiness correction; later there 
      will be several video demos of this issue. A coefficient of restitution 
      is used to model the energy loss in the wall collisions. Notice 
      the apparent settling of the cars at the end of the video.</p>

      <p>Car-car collision physics and car-car stickiness correction are 
      added here. This script uses the "c" and the "s" keys to toggle 
      two algorithmic features that help to illustrate the collisions 
      and stickiness. The "c" key toggles the "color-transfer" feature 
      which, when enabled, causes the colors of two colliding cars to 
      swap. So when two cars start to settle near a wall under the influence 
      of gravity, they collide frequently and the colors will swap quickly 
      to show the cars are still colliding. If this feature is off the 
      cars will appear to settle, but the cars really don't settle in 
      our basic physic engine! (Later with Box2D we will show true settling.) 
      The "s" toggles the stickiness correction on and off. So if you 
      turn off the correction, the cars will be pulled into each other 
      as they settle. Hit the "s" key again and they will unstick with 
      a little pop. A combination of the "c" and "s" key is used at the 
      tail end of the video. Sorry, this one runs a little long (kind 
      of like watching paint dry).<br><br></p>

      <p>The user gets to interact with the objects on the screen. Cursor 
      spring and drag forces are calculated based on the separation distance 
      between the cursor and the selected car (and the velocity of the 
      car). Cars are selected by clicking on the car or holding down the 
      mouse button and letting the car run over the cursor. Cursors attach 
      at the center of the car. Each mouse button invokes a different 
      cursor tether (with a different spring constant and car drag coefficient). 
      The left mouse button is medium, the right mouse button is stiff, 
      and the center (roller) button has the softest spring. The video 
      closes with me trying to pull the car into the wall. The color transfer 
      ("c") is turned on so the frequent collisions are illustrated. Note 
      you can again turn off the stickiness correction here ("s") and 
      pull the cars into the wall; then toggle it off and watch them pop 
      out (not so much "paint drying" here since you can pull them in 
      pretty quickly, especially with the stiffer of the three cursor 
      tethers).</p>

      <p>Car mass is visualized here by hollowing out the lighter cars. 
      The video shows 10 of the 13 demos. The demo number is indicated 
      in the window title (upper part of the Pygame window frame). Demo 
      #4 shows the inelastic collisions between a set of cars where the 
      total momentum of the set is zero before and after the collision 
      (a reverse explosion). Most of the other demos make use of the color-transfer 
      feature to highlight the transfer of momentum through cars (like 
      Newton's cradle). A description of each demo is in the PDF.</p>

      <p>This counting method, documented in Galperin's 2003 
      <a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>, 
      is beautifully described in this 3Blue1Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE" target="_blank">video</a>.
      Our 1D engine is modified here to facilitate the counting of the elastic collisions in this method. 
      A mass ratio of 100 to the 4th power is used in the video here (surface area ratio of 100, density ratio of 100^3) and yields the first 5 digits of pi.
      Play this video fullscreen to see the blue counter on the far right. Or try this <a href="https://triquence.org/?1c" target="_blank">interactive</a> 2-digit version using Box2D.</p>
      
      <p>A secondary loop runs the physics calculations 1000 times per rendering frame. The collision sound (the clack) plays at most once per frame. 
      Alternating collisions (block-block, then block-wall) are enforced in the code and the large block is not allowed to collide with the walls.</p>
      
      <p>This is an addition to the <a href="A07_air_track_hollow_cars.html" target="_blank">code</a> of the "Hollow Cars and Demos" topic above. Just scrape the code from there if you'd like to try this.
      To run it press the 4 key on a number pad or use shift and the 4 key on the main keyboard.
      You'll need the <a href="clack_long.wav">clack_long.wav</a> file in the same directory as your python file. To try different mass ratios, edit
      the parameters in the 4p block of the make_some_cars method.

      <p>The video shows a vector sandbox that is based on the vector

      selected with the mouse (click and drag over the arrow head). Components 
      of selected vectors can be displayed ("c" key toggles this on/off). 
      Components include x, y, unit normal (red), unit perpendicular (red), 
      and the projection of the selected vector onto a second vector. 
      Vector rotation can be toggled on/off with the "f" key. The "a" 
      key toggles the display of the add vector (grand total), which is 
      shown in green. In "add" mode each vector in the sum series is rendered 
      head to tail. The "t" key toggles on/off the display of a tail drawn 
      from the head of the total vector. The tail is represented with 
      a 350 point FIFO list of the most recent points. The tail can be

      <p>This assignment merges the 1D engine with the 2D vector class 
      and the multiplayer module. The spring class is also introduced 
      here. There are drawings in the PDF that explain 2D collisions, 
      stickiness corrections, and the client-server relationship.</p>
      <p>The video shows two cursors, one from the local client and the 
      other from a network client on a laptop. Left and right hands are 
      working the two cursors. It's surprisingly natural (we've got two 
      hands). One section of the video shows the two cursors' tethers 
      pulling two balls together and watching the transition from stable 
      to unstable as the cursors cross each other; once unstable, the 
      balls flip their positions to get back to stability. Stickiness 
      behavior is toggled on/off with the "p" key; the black background 
      turns grey when the stickiness corrections are off.</p>
      <p>The client script that is used here works with all the following 
      assignments (except the first two in the Box2D section).</p>

      <p>A raw tube and a jet tube are associated with a client-controlled 
      puck. The association causes the tubes to move with (are drawn relative 
      to the center of mass of) the pucks. A new three-point red polygon 
      is used to represent the jet's exhaust flame. The video shows the 
      local client and a network client controlling (rotating) tubes on 
      the two pucks. Python inheritance is introduced in this exercise: 
      jet-tube is derived from the tube base class.</p>

      is modeled with an impulse force. Each bullet firing causes an opposing 
      impulse force to be delivered to the gun. The magnitude of this 
      force is equal to the change in momentum of the bullet divided by 
      the duration of the firing interval (one step in time by the physics 
      calculations in the game loop). Bullet clean-up is implemented by 
      assigning a birth time to each fired bullet. Bullet objects older 
      than 3 seconds are deleted.</p>

      <p>This assignment adds features to make a playable game. For example, 
      a hit counter (a hit by another player makes your puck flash red) 
      is the basis for establishing the health of each player. Health, 
      or rather the lack of it, is illustrated with an expanding red circle. 
      Too many hits and your puck pops (hence the name of the game: Puck 
      Popper). Shields (hold down the space bar) prevent bullets from 
      hitting your puck; when shields are up, you can't fire. The "s" 
      and "k" keys are used to flip the tube directions into an orientation 
      opposing the current motion of the puck; this can be useful in breaking 
      (stopping). The "a","d", and "w" keys orient and fire the jet; the 
      "j","l", and "i" keys orient and fire the gun. The "f" and "g" keys 
      can add an interesting dimension to the game by the local user (user 
      on the server computer); try it.<br><br>

      The jello simulation that's shown in a few of the other videos 
      has been turned into a game here (shown in the second half of this 
      video). You scramble the jello (this starts the timer) for your 
      opponent then press the "p" key to freeze the physics engine and 
      the corresponding timer on the screen. When your opponent is ready 
      to try and straighten out the jello, they press the "p" key again. 
      That resets and starts the timer and physics engine. When the jello 
      is straightened (no puck collisions), the timer will stop. A useful 
      tool to use in the straightening is repeated use of the "f" key. 
      This momentarily sets the velocity of each puck to zero. Low score 
      (time) wins. Players take turns.</p>
      <p>The video shows me playing Puck Popper solo with something heavy 
      sitting on the "i" key of my laptop. So the red player is pretty 
      much a sitting duck in the corner. But you get the idea of the shields, 
      health circles, and the popping pucks. I also do one round of Jello 
      Madness and got a de-tangling time of 22.15 seconds (a big part 
      of this is to really make a mess of it for the other guy). Jello 
      Madness requires an I5 processor or better; this will crash (become 
      unstable) on slower machines.<br></p>

      <p>The perfect-kiss algorithm is a refinement to the overlap-correction 
      calculations described in the <em>2D-Physics Engine Framework</em> 
      assignment. This refinement offers true contact-normal calculations 
      and corresponding ideal modeling of 2D puck collisions. The video 
      is annotated to show three categories of puck collisions: (1) raw 
      (no overlap correction), (2) overlap correction using the approximate-contact 
      normal, and (3) overlap correction using the idea-contact normal. 
      The speed of the incoming puck is chosen to produce large overlaps 
      and its initial position is randomized to show a variety of responses. 
      The third category of runs shows a consistent collision prediction 
      that is independent of the amount of overlap at the collision detection 
      point. To illustrate the correction process, two intermediate steps 
      are drawn with special colors: Both overlapping pucks are drawn 
      in red; Both kissing pucks are drawn in cyan. The final corrected 
      position is drawn in normal puck colors. There are cases where some 
      of the intermediate puck images are not visible because they lie 
      directly underneath a subsequent drawing.</p>

      <p>The ideal collisions of the previous topic support reversibility in our 2D framework.
      This means an ordered set of pucks can be disordered through a series of collisions and then
      returned to order by reversing the direction of the time step or by reversing the velocity
      of each of the pucks. This produces a very counterintuitive result, like watching a scrambled egg
      return to the shell by playing a video in reverse, decreasing entropy.</p>
      
      <p>The video shows each of the first four demos running in perfect-kiss mode (background turns from black to gray), flinging a puck to disorder the set,
      waiting for disorder, then pressing the "r" key to reverse all the puck velocities. The
      collision counter (upper left) will start counting in the reverse direction at this point.
      As the counter approaches zero, order returns and flings the ball back where 
      it is caught with the mouse. Watch fullscreen to better see the output from the command line.</p>
      
      <p>Keyboard commands for playing with reversibility: </p>
      <p>
      &quot;<strong>z</strong>&quot; enables the Perfect Kiss algorithm. This 
      also set each puck to be elastic; coefficient of restitution 
      is set to 1.0.<br>&quot;<strong>r</strong>&quot; reverses the velocity of each puck.<br>&quot;<strong>shift-r</strong>&quot; reverses the direction of the timestep. 
      Note 
      time reversal differs from velocity reversal in that spring 
      losses, dampers, will gain energy, generally behaving 
      unstable. So if you intend to use the mouse, velocity 
      reversal, &quot;r&quot;, works best.<br>&quot;<strong>shift-p</strong>&quot; clamps the framerate at the current value and 
      then steps the engine in equal interval steps (inverse of 
      the clamped rate). The clamped framerate value is shown in 
      parentheses.<br>&quot;<strong>e</strong>&quot; sets all collisions to be elastic; useful for 
      testing without Perfect Kissing.<br>&quot;<strong>t</strong>&quot; starts and stops a general timer.

      <p>This script is based on the test_BodyTypes.py file in the examples 
      directory of the pybox2d distribution. This depends on the Pygame 
      framework in that distribution so all the framework files must be 
      in the same directory as this file. (This script works best if you 
      run it in the box2d_jdm <!--"...box2d_source_files\box2d_jdm" --> folder of the zip 
      distribution provided above.)</p>
      <p>This file has been modified to support bullet shooting. (I looked 
      through their examples for one that had some hinged object that 
      would work for aiming the projectile stream.) The main adders here 
      are: (1) bullet aiming and firing, (2) masking of objects (bullets 
      pass through the gun base without a collision), (3) age limits on 
      the bullets so they clean up after themselves (the simulation would 
      labor if the collection of bullets kept growing), (4) the cursor 
      gun, (5) something interesting to shoot at (target generation): 
      pyramids, circles, and squares.</p>

      <p>This script is based on the simple_01.py example in the pybox2d 
      example directory. Unlike the example above, this one does not depend 
      on the framework files, so it will run anywhere. I've extracted 
      mouse-joint and zooming features as well as some basic polygon rendering 
      facilitated by Pygame. This demonstrates the body-transform overload 
      operation on a vertex of a polygon (to get its physics-world coordinates). 
      There are also two force points defined on one of the cars (keyboard 
      controlled).</p>
      <p>The video shows an air-track type environment, except of course 
      this is 2D and the cars are allowed to behave very badly and can 
      end up off the track. Cars can be dragged with the mouse. Zoom the 
      view with the mouse wheel; pan the view with the right mouse button. 
      Control the two force points with the "f" and "g" keys. When a force 
      is applied at a force point, the point lights up green. (View in 
      full-screen mode at 480p to see the force points.)</p>

      <p>Finally, here is an integration of the Box2D engine into our 
      own 2D framework. This is like taking the engine out of our Honda 
      Civic and replacing it with a 426 Hemi. This opens the door to non-spherical 
      object collisions, object rotation, torque (and rotational drag), 
      surface friction, and true settling behaviors.</p>
      <p>The basic idea here is that we define an interface between our 
      air-table framework and the Box2D engine using force points. So 
      we keep all the force generating objects such as springs and cursor-tethers 
      and communicate their forces to the Box2D world. Then we let the engine 
      take care of collisions and object motion and let it inform our 
      rendering functionality as to the state/position of the objects.</p>
      <p>A few notes on the interface: gun and jet controls are the same 
      as before. The "t" key will torque a selected object. Shift-t will 
      torque it the other way. The "f" key still freezes the translational 
      motion, but now there is also the "r" key which will stop the rotation 
      of all the objects in the world. Cursor tethers attach, by default, 
      to the center of mass of the object, but with the shift key down, 
      you can attach cursor tether anywhere on the object. The "h" and 
      "n" keys zoom the view in and out; if the control key is down, mouse 
      movement acts to pan the view. Various demos are initiated as usual 
      with the keyboard number keys (i.e. above the letters). In this 
      video I have one network client, a laptop, connected (red cursor); 
      the regular cursor is controlled by the server.</p>
